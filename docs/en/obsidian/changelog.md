- Split-view mode now synchronizes the mind map’s core data (basic configurations and settings are not synchronized).  
- Clicking the save button in the top-right stores the current preview image, which can then be embedded into Markdown documents using `![[.smm.md]]` to display as an image. The image updates in real time when the source file is modified, and double-clicking the image opens the mind map editor.  
- Node statistics have been added to the bottom status bar.

- Image upload dialog for node images now supports dragging images directly from the Obsidian file list.  
- Pasted images are now automatically saved as files in the vault.  
- Added **Copy as Obsidian Internal Link** to the node right-click menu; opening the link automatically focuses on that node.  
- **Internal Links**:  
  - Improved editing of rich-text internal links within nodes: during editing, raw syntax like `[[xxx]]` is shown; after editing, it renders as a clickable link. Supports suffixes like `#`, `^`, and `|`.

- When exporting to `.smm`, `.json`, or `.xmind`, images using Obsidian paths are converted to base64.  
- Added links in settings for submitting issues and downloading the desktop client.

- Added settings for prefix and datetime format in new mind map filenames.  
- Added onboarding guidance for first-time plugin users.

5:
